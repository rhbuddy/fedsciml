# Federated scientific machine learning for approximating functions and solving differential equations with data heterogeneity

The data and code for the paper H. Zhang, L. Liu, K. Weng, & L. Lu. [Federated scientific machine learning for approximating functions and solving differential equations with data heterogeneity.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11053778) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 36 (10), 18104–18117, 2025.

## Datasets

Data generation scripts are available in the [data](data) folder:

- [Antiderivative](data/data_gen_antid_100.py)
- [Burgers equation](data/data_gen_burgers_101_101.py)
- [Diffusion-reaction equation](data/data_gen_dr_101_101.py)
- [Lid-driven cavity flow](data/data_gen_cavity.py)

Also you may check the helper functions in [data_assignment](data/data_assignment.py) file for data generation for federated learning setting for 1D and 2D problem. Details are shown in Sec.II in the paper.

## Code

All codes are provided in the folder [src](src), including training centralized baseline models, federated models and extrapolation models. The code depends on the deep learning package [DeepXDE](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde).
